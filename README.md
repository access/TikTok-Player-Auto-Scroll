### Auto Scroll for TikTok Player


Auto scrolling videos in TikTok with full screen option
This Chrome Extension allows you to view TikTok videos from your PC (Chrome Browser) in an endless loop, without need to select the next video with your mouse or keyboard.

When the "Auto-Play" view mode is enabled, the video is expanded to fit the browser. In full screen view (F11 key), the video is shown in full screen.

When the playlist ends, the application automatically restarts the tab and loads fresh videos and a new playlist. When the full screen view mode is enabled (F11 key), the video is also expanded to full screen.
